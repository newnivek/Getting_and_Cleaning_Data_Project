# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Project
Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
